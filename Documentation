📚 Learning Path Recommender AI Agent

An intelligent AI agent that compresses course catalogs and student progress data to generate adaptive, goal-driven, and time-efficient personalized learning paths.

🚀 Overview

The Learning Path Recommender is an AI-powered system designed to help learners stay on track with their academic or skill-based goals.
It analyzes a student’s prior knowledge, performance, goals, and time availability to generate a customized learning roadmap that adapts over time.

The agent ensures learners:

Study only what they need

Skip already-mastered concepts

Revise weak areas

Learn efficiently within their time constraints

🎯 Core Idea (Agent’s Job)

The agent acts as a learning support system that:

Takes input about a learner’s:

Previous academic achievements

Existing knowledge in the chosen course

Conducts a diagnostic assessment test

Generates a personalized learning plan based on the test score

Continuously adapts the plan based on learner performance and confidence

🧠 Knowledge Assessment Logic

Based on the diagnostic test score:

🟢 Score > 80%

Learner has strong prerequisite knowledge

Agent:

Generates an optimized learning plan

Estimates time per topic

Suggests revision time

Recommends number of practice tests/projects

🟡 Score between 60% – 80%

Learner has partial understanding

Agent:

Suggests revisiting weak concepts

Extends learning duration

Provides a slower, foundation-focused plan

🔴 Score < 60%

Learner lacks basic prerequisites

Agent:

Recommends relearning fundamentals

Reassesses using a test

Unlocks advanced course only after improvement

🧩 Learning Structure
Course → Units → Topics → Skills


Each level is analyzed to detect gaps and optimize learning flow.

🔑 Key Features
(A) Course Compression Engine

AI Task: NLP-based summarization & clustering

Converts long course descriptions into:

Core concepts

Required prerequisites

Expected learning outcomes

Avoids redundant course recommendations

Example:

Instead of suggesting 10 Python courses →
“Learn loops → functions → lists → OOP → projects”

(B) Knowledge Gap Detector

AI Task: Skill comparison & gap analysis

Compares:

What the learner already knows

What the course requires

Highlights only missing or weak topics

Example:

If learner already knows OOP → skip theory → jump to project-based learning

(C) Dynamic Learning Path Generator

AI Task: Personalized curriculum sequencing

Generates a step-by-step roadmap.

Example Output:

Revise Algebra Basics – 2 days
Learn Linear Equations – 3 days
Practice Word Problems – 1 day
Weekly Mini Test

(D) Adaptive Path Updating

AI Task: Reinforcement learning / feedback loop

If learner struggles → slow down + revise

If learner performs well → fast-track content

Learning path updates dynamically (not static)

(E) Time-Based Scheduling

AI Task: Constraint optimization

Designs plans based on available time.

Examples:

⏱ 30 minutes/day → micro-lessons

⏱ 2 hours/day → deep learning blocks

🧠 Student Profile Modeling

The agent maintains a learner profile containing:

Current knowledge level

Completed topics

Strengths and weak areas

Learning goals (exam, skill, career, curiosity)

Available time per day/week

AI Task: User modeling & personalization

🛠️ AI Techniques Used
🔹 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Course text summarization

Keyword extraction

Topic clustering

🔹 Recommendation Systems

Content-based filtering (skills vs goals)

Similar learner path analysis

🔹 Knowledge Graphs (Core Strength 💡)

Nodes → topics / skills

Edges → prerequisites

AI finds the shortest valid learning path
